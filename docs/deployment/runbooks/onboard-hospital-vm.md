# Hospital VM Onboarding Runbook

> **Script**: `scripts/powershell/arc-setup.ps1`
> **When to use**: Onboarding a new NHS hospital gateway VM to Azure Arc for the first time

---

## Prerequisites

- [ ] Hospital IT has provisioned the gateway VM (Windows Server 2022 or later)
- [ ] VM has outbound internet access to:
  - `*.arc.azure.com`
  - `*.his.arc.azure.com`
  - `relay-manbrs-<env>.servicebus.windows.net`
- [ ] Trust ODS code confirmed via the [ODS portal](https://odsportal.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/)
- [ ] NHS region confirmed (`nw` | `neyh` | `mids` | `eoe` | `lon` | `se` | `sw`)
- [ ] Deployment ring agreed with the programme team
- [ ] `arc-onboarding-spn-client-id` and `arc-onboarding-spn-client-secret` retrieved from Key Vault

---

## Step 1 — Determine site parameters

The Arc resource name is built automatically from `SiteName`, `ODSCode`, and `Instance`:

```text
gw-<SiteName>-<ODSCode>-<Instance>
```

All lowercase, hyphens only. Azure constraint: max 54 characters (`a-z A-Z 0-9 - _ .`).

| Parameter | Format | Example |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| `SiteName` | Trust name, hyphen-separated, no spaces | `Hull-University-Teaching-Hospitals-NHS-Trust` |
| `ODSCode` | ODS code (uppercase input, lowercased in name) | `RWA` |
| `Instance` | Zero-padded instance number | `01` |
| `NHSRegion` | One of: `nw` `neyh` `mids` `eoe` `lon` `se` `sw` | `neyh` |
| `SiteType` | `static` or `mobile` | `static` |
| `DeploymentRing` | `ring1`–`ring4` (see below) | `ring1` |

> **Example**: `SiteName=Hull-University-Teaching-Hospitals-NHS-Trust`, `ODSCode=RWA`, `Instance=01`
> → Arc resource name: `gw-hull-university-teaching-hospitals-nhs-trust-rwa-01` (54 chars — at the limit)

**Ring assignments:**

| Ring | Sites |
|------|-------|
| ring0 | Test VM only (`mbsgw-review`) |
| ring1 | 1 site per PACS vendor (first real sites) |
| ring2 | 1 site per NHS region |
| ring3 | Remaining static sites |
| ring4 | Mobile units |

## Step 2 — Run Arc onboarding script on the gateway VM

Copy [`scripts/powershell/arc-setup.ps1`](../../../scripts/powershell/arc-setup.ps1) to the VM and run from an **elevated PowerShell session**.

If script execution is disabled on the VM, allow it for the current session first:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process
```

> This only affects the current PowerShell process and does not change the machine-wide policy.
> If the script was downloaded from the internet and is still blocked, see [Script execution blocked](#script-execution-blocked) in Troubleshooting.

```powershell
.\arc-setup.ps1 `
    -SubscriptionId         "<spoke-subscription-id>" `
    -TenantId               "<tenant-id>" `
    -ResourceGroup          "rg-mbsgw-<env>-uks-arc-enabled-servers" `
    -Location               "uksouth" `
    -ServicePrincipalId     "<arc-onboarding-spn-client-id>" `
    -ServicePrincipalSecret "<arc-onboarding-spn-client-secret>" `
    -SiteName               "Hull-University-Teaching-Hospitals-NHS-Trust" `
    -ODSCode                "RWA" `
    -Instance               "01" `
    -NHSRegion              "neyh" `
    -SiteType               "static" `
    -DeploymentRing         "ring1"
```

The script will:

1. Install the Azure Arc agent (`azcmagent`) if not already present
2. Build the Arc resource name: `gw-hull-university-teaching-hospitals-nhs-trust-rwa-01`
3. Stamp site metadata as tags on the Arc machine resource
4. Connect the VM to Azure Arc with `--resource-name` set to the built resource name

Logs are written to `C:\ArcSetup\ArcSetup.log`.

**Verify**: In the Azure portal, navigate to `rg-mbsgw-<env>-uks-arc-enabled-servers` → Azure Arc machines → `gw-hull-university-teaching-hospitals-nhs-trust-rwa-01`. Status should be **Connected**.

## Step 3 — Trigger Terraform to provision the Hybrid Connection

Run the ADO pipeline **Deploy Arc Infrastructure - \<env\>** manually. Terraform discovers the new Arc machine and creates:

- `hc-gw-hull-university-teaching-hospitals-nhs-trust-rwa-01` in the relay namespace (`relay-manbrs-<env>`)
- `listen` auth rule on that Hybrid Connection

**Verify**: In the Azure portal, navigate to `relay-manbrs-<env>` → Hybrid Connections → `hc-gw-hull-university-teaching-hospitals-nhs-trust-rwa-01` is present.

## Step 4 — Deploy the gateway application

Run the ADO pipeline **Deploy Gateway - \<env\>** with:

```text
targetSiteCode : gw-hull-university-teaching-hospitals-nhs-trust-rwa-01
releaseTag     : latest        (or a specific tag, e.g. v1.2.3)
```

The pipeline:

1. Retrieves the listen SAS key for `hc-gw-hull-university-teaching-hospitals-nhs-trust-rwa-01`
2. Sends an Arc Run Command to `gw-hull-university-teaching-hospitals-nhs-trust-rwa-01` that writes `.env` and runs `deploy.ps1`
3. Polls for completion and reports success or failure

## Step 5 — Smoke test

Run from the gateway VM or via Arc Run Command:

```powershell
Get-Service Gateway-PACS, Gateway-MWL, Gateway-Upload, Gateway-Relay | Select-Object Name, Status
```

Expected: all four services **Running**.

## Troubleshooting

### Arc agent fails to connect

Check `C:\ArcSetup\ArcSetup.log` on the VM. Common causes:

- **Firewall blocking outbound** — confirm the VM can reach `*.arc.azure.com` on port 443
- **SPN credentials wrong** — verify client ID and secret from Key Vault are current
- **VM already registered** — if the machine was previously connected under a different name, disconnect first: `azcmagent disconnect`

### Script execution blocked

If you see `running scripts is disabled on this system`, run this first in the same elevated session:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process
```

If the script was downloaded from the internet and is still blocked (error: `file is not digitally signed`), unblock the zone restriction first:

```powershell
Unblock-File -Path .\arc-setup.ps1
```

If the script is still blocked after `Unblock-File` (e.g. due to a stricter machine policy), use `Unrestricted` instead — still scoped to the current process only:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process
```

### Arc machine shows as Disconnected after onboarding

The agent may have lost connectivity. Check:

```powershell
azcmagent show
```

If disconnected, re-run the script. It is safe to re-run — the agent will reconnect and update tags.

### Hybrid Connection not created after Terraform run

The Arc machine must appear in the resource group before Terraform can create the HC. Confirm the machine is **Connected** in the portal (Step 2 verify), then re-run the pipeline.

### Gateway services not starting after deploy

Check the deployment log on the VM:

```powershell
Get-ChildItem "C:\Program Files\NHS\ManageBreastScreeningGateway\logs\deployments\deploy-*" |
    Sort-Object LastWriteTime -Descending | Select-Object -First 1 |
    ForEach-Object { Get-Content $_.FullName }
```
